## Introduction

Crontab is a powerful utility in Unix-like operating systems that allows you to schedule and automate tasks at predefined intervals. It uses a cron daemon to execute commands or scripts according to a specified schedule. This cheat sheet provides an overview of crontab syntax and demonstrates practical examples to help you effectively schedule recurring tasks.

## Difference between Cron, Crontab, and Cron Job

The provided table illustrates the key elements related to scheduling tasks using cron in Linux systems.

| Element | Linux Name | Meaning                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daemon  | `crond`    | Pronounced "demon" or "day-mon". These are Linux background system processes.                                                                                      |
| Table   | `crontab`  | You write rows to this table when entering a crontab command. Each `*` asterisk represents a segment of time and a corresponding column in each row.                |
| Job     | Cron Job   | The specific task to be performed described in a row, paired with its designated time id.                                                                             |

### Cron

Cron is the name of the system daemon responsible for executing scheduled tasks in Unix-like operating systems. It runs in the background and periodically checks the system's crontab files to determine which tasks need to be executed.

### Crontab

Crontab, short for "cron tables," refers to the file or files that contain the scheduled task definitions for individual users. Each user has their own crontab file where they can define the timing and commands or scripts to be executed at specific intervals. Crontab files are used to configure and manage scheduled tasks for each user.

### Cron Job

A cron job refers to a specific task or command that is scheduled to run at a designated time or interval using the crontab file. Users define their cron jobs in their crontab files by specifying the timing and the command or script to be executed. Each cron job is a separate entry within the crontab file, allowing users to schedule multiple tasks according to their specific requirements.

In summary, Cron is the system daemon responsible for executing scheduled tasks, Crontab is the file used to define scheduled tasks for individual users, and Cron Job refers to a specific task scheduled using the crontab file.

## Crontab Syntax

To create and manage cron jobs using crontab, you need to understand the syntax. Each line in a crontab file represents a cron job and consists of six fields separated by spaces. The fields denote the scheduling details, as follows:

```bash
* * * * * command_to_be_executed
┬ ┬ ┬ ┬ ┬
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─ Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
│ │ │ └───── Month (1 - 12)
│ │ └────────── Day of the month (1 - 31)
│ └─────────────── Hour (0 - 23)
└──────────────────── Minute (0 - 59)
```

The code snippet below represents the contents of the `/etc/crontab` file. This file is a system-wide crontab file in Linux that contains scheduled tasks for various users. It starts with the definition of the shell (`/bin/bash`) and the system's search path (`PATH`).

The `MAILTO` variable specifies the recipient for any command output or errors. The subsequent lines include commented examples that demonstrate the syntax for defining cron jobs. Each line shows the order of time units (minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week) followed by the user and command to be executed at the specified time.

This file serves as a reference and guide for configuring cron jobs in a Linux system.

```bash
cat /etc/crontab

SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root

# For details see man 4 crontabs

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed
```

Each field can be specified as a single value, a comma-separated list of values, a range, or an asterisk (*) to denote all possible values. Here are some examples:

- `*` indicates all possible values for that field.
- `5,10,15` denotes the values 5, 10, and 15.
- `1-5` represents a range from 1 to 5.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Running a Script Every Hour

To schedule a script to run every hour, use the following crontab entry:

```plaintext
0 * * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

This executes the script located at `/path/to/script.sh` at the start of every hour.

### Example 2: Running a Script Every Day at a Specific Time

To schedule a script to run every day at a specific time, use the following crontab entry:

```plaintext
30 9 * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

This executes the script at `/path/to/script.sh` at 9:30 AM every day.

### Example 3: Running a Script on Specific Days of the Week

To schedule a script to run on specific days of the week, use the following crontab entry:

```plaintext
0 10 * * 1,3,5 /path/to/script.sh
```

This executes the script at `/path/to/script.sh` at 10:00 AM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

### Example 4: Running a Script Every Month

To schedule a script to run every month on a specific day, use the following crontab entry:

```plaintext
0 12 15 * * /path/to/script.sh
```

This executes the script at `/path/to/script.sh` at 12:00 PM on the 15th day of every month.

### Example 5: Running a Script at Regular Intervals

To schedule a script to run at regular intervals, such as every 10 minutes, use the following crontab entry:

```plaintext
*/10 * * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

This executes the script at `/path/to/script.sh` every 10 minutes.

## Managing Crontab Entries

To manage your crontab entries, you can use the following commands:

- `crontab -e` - Edit the crontab file.
- `crontab -l` - List existing crontab entries.
- `crontab -r` - Remove all crontab entries.

## Conclusion

Crontab is a valuable tool for automating recurring tasks in Unix-like systems. With the examples provided in this cheat sheet, you can effectively schedule and manage your cron jobs. Remember to consider the syntax and time-sensitive details while creating your crontab entries.
