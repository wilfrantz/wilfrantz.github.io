Iâ€™m Wilfrantz, and Iâ€™m excited to have you here on my portfolio, documentation, and personal blog! As a Systems Software Engineer and macOS Malware Analyst, I dive deep into cybersecurity, reverse engineering, Linux systems administration, and low-level systems programming using C/C++, Python, and Bash scripting.

Iâ€™m passionate about understanding how software works at its core, from analyzing Mach-O binaries and bypassing malware detection to optimizing system performance and automating workflows. Whether itâ€™s digging into ARM64 assembly, writing shellcode, or exploring Linux internals, I love uncovering the deeper mechanics of operating systems. Oh, and letâ€™s not forgetâ€”Iâ€™m a Vim enthusiast through and through. Efficiency is key! ðŸ˜‰

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m also driven by the desire to build and automate businesses. My goal is to create sustainable income streams that give me the freedom to enjoy quality time with my family. Thatâ€™s why I explore digital investments, web development (Jekyll), and data-driven business models, combining my passion for technology with entrepreneurship.

So, buckle up and join me on this journey! Here, weâ€™ll delve into systems programming, cybersecurity research, scripting, and more, sharing insights, tackling complex problems, and continuously pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in tech. Letâ€™s build, break, and innovate together! ðŸš€
