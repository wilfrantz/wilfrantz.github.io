# Hey

Iâ€™m DEDE, and welcome to my portfolio, documentation, and personal blog! As a Systems Software Engineer and macOS Malware Analyst, Iâ€™m constantly immersed in cybersecurity, reverse engineering, Linux sysadmin work, and low-level programming with `C/C++`, `Python`, and `Bash`.

I have a real passion for digging into how software works under the hoodâ€”whether itâ€™s analyzing Mach-O binaries, bypassing malware detection, or optimizing system performance. I get a real thrill from automating workflows and exploring the inner workings of operating systems, from ARM64 assembly to Linux internals. And yep, Iâ€™m a die-hard Vim fanâ€”efficiency is everything!

But itâ€™s not just about tech for me. Iâ€™m also focused on building sustainable businesses that give me the flexibility to spend more time with my family. I dive into digital investments, web development (with Jekyll), and data-driven business models to blend my love for technology with entrepreneurship.

So, join me on this journey! Weâ€™ll explore systems programming, cybersecurity research, scripting, and moreâ€”solving problems, sharing ideas, and pushing the limits of what we can achieve together. Letâ€™s build, break, and innovate! ðŸš€
